                Going To School Helps Children Strengthen Their 
                Communication Skills, Aids Physical Development 
                And Assists With Emotional And Intellectual 
                Development. It Also Gives Children The Opportunity 
                To Interact With Peers, Make Friends And Be Part 
                Of Their Community. Unfortunately, Most Children 
                With Special Needs In Puerto Peñasco Do Not Have 
                Access To The Quality Education They Need To Develop 
                Their Skills And Realize Their Full Potential. 
                The Educarte Learning Center Was Established To 
                Provide More Kids With Disabilities In The Community 
                The Chance To Attend School On A Daily Basis.

				<h3>Educarte Learning Center</h3>
				<p>
					Going to school helps children strengthen their communication skills, 
					aids physical development and assists with emotional and intellectual 
					development. It also gives children the opportunity to interact with 
					peers, make friends and be part of their community. Unfortunately, 
					most children with special needs in Puerto Peñasco do not have access 
					to the quality education they need to develop their skills and realize 
					their full potential. The Educarte Learning Center was established to 
					provide more kids with disabilities in the community the chance to 
					attend school on a daily basis.

By supporting Educarte you can help us ensure that all young people in this community receive the professional support they need to thrive and participate fully in life.

					A monthly sponsorship is a unique opportuity to enable a child to reach their potential:

					$50/month provides one week of tuition at the Educarte Learning Center. 
					$100/provides two weeks of therapies at the C.A.T.I. clinic.
					$200/month provides a full month of professional support in the C.A.T.I.
